# GeneticAlgorithm Repository

## Main Idea
- This repository holds assignment #1 for CSCI-561, Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, which focuses on solving a 3D Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a genetic algorithm. Here, the AI agent finds the shortest path through a set of cities with 3D coordinates. The agent starts at a specified "home" location, travels to various cities, and returns home, aiming to minimize the distance traveled. Key aspects include implementing initial population generation, parent selection, crossover between parents, and mutation.
