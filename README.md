 # GeneticAlgorithm Repository

## Main Idea
This repository holds assignment #1 for CSCI-561, Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, which focuses on solving a 3D Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the genetic algorithm. Here, the AI agent is given a list of cities represented by coordinates of the format (x, y, z). It then employs the genetic algorithm to find the shortest path through a set of cities, starting and ending at the same city while visiting all other cities exactly once. Key aspects of this agent include:
- Initial generation of paths
- Path ranking
- Crossover between best paths
- And mutation of path 'offspring'

This project is implemented entirely from scratch in Python.

### Key Functions:
#### calculateDistance()
- Accepts two coordinates of any dimension and returns the Euclidean distance between the two points. In this projectâ€™s scope, it is used to calculate the distance between two cities in the 3D space.

#### generateInitialPopulation()
- Generates unique, valid paths that start and end at the same city and visit all other cities exactly once. It is used to seed the genetic algorithm with a population of paths that can be used to create future generations.

#### rankPopulation()
- Ranks the given population. It finds the distance required to travel each path in the population and returns a sorted list of paths in ascending order of distance.
